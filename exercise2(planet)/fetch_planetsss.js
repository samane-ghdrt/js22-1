//2. Add the code to fetch this URL
//   -The data you receive as a response should be an array containing 6 objects
//3. show the first planet name and distance(first index of the array data)
//4. let's dynamically change which planet's info we're displaying each time the element with id "destination" is clicked. To do this:
//      a) Declare a counter variable, index that changes each time a click event takes place.
//      b) Use the value of index as the position in the planets array to use in the template literal.
//      c) Lastly, to ensure that the value of the index does not surpass the length of the planets array, implement a mechanism to control the maximum allowed value for the index
